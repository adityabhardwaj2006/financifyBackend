"""
Synonym Dictionary Engine.

A curated, configurable mapping from commonly-seen financial label variants
to their canonical names.  The dictionary is the **first** (and most
trustworthy) matching layer — it fires before fuzzy matching.

Design decisions
----------------
* Keys are stored **normalised** (lowercase, stripped) so that a single
  normalisation pass on the input label is sufficient for lookup.
* The built-in dictionary ships with ~200 entries covering Indian and
  international financial reporting conventions.
* Users can extend at runtime via ``load_custom_synonyms`` (JSON file) or
  ``add_synonym`` / ``add_synonyms``.
